https://github.com/StewMH/OptimisationWorkshop

Material for workshop on optimisation and profiling for data-intensive science.

Examples are likely to work best with native Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04), or Mac with Homebrew. Note that perf is only available on linux

Need: g++, clang, gdb, valgrind (or ssh access to a machine with these installed)

Nice to have: google-perftools, libjemalloc, massif-visualizer, perf
